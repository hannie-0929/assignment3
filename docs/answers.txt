4. Branches are used so multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously.
Branches can also be used to store code in the cloud in the case of hard drives being corrupted and losing the local storage of code.

5. The log shows the history of commits, while status shows if your files have been modified without a commit or push.

6. $ git log Vehicle.h

commit f4975e5d56ff331762b318bfd12c5236e0299f25 (upstream/master, upstream/HEAD)

    -> Adding an empty README.md file
8. I. Inheritance allows a class to use the same properties and methods as another class, by "inheriting" these.
II.Polymorphism allows a class to override the objects in the base class.
III. Encapsulation lets you restrict access to some of the classes objects by making them private. This allows controlled access to only objects that are public.

9. The integration method uses multiple repositories. This allows for changes to be made on the public repos, before commiting them to the "blessed repository." The dictator and lieutenants workflow utilizes one central repo, that only the dictator can push to. Everyone has access to pull from it, but their changes
have to be pushed by the dictator. The developers have to push their changes into the lieutenant repository, where the dictator can then make the push into the blessed repository. 

10. A team of 100 developers would benefit from this dictator workflow because their changes would have to be pushed by the dictator. You would not have to worry about the repository being tarnished by another developer, because their changes will not be pushed on their own. They will have to go through
the dictator before being pushed, which will mitigate errors. This can also lessen the chances of malicious code being pushed into the blessed repository, as not every developer will have access.
